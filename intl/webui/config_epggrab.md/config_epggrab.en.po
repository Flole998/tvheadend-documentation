"mechanisms. These fall into 3 broad categories, within which there are a "
"variety of specific grabber implementations."

msgid "Over-the-Air (OTA)"

msgid ""
": These grabbers receive EPG data directly from the DVB network. This is "
"often the easiest way to get up and running and does provide timely updates "
"should scheduling change. However, the information isn’t always as rich as "
"some of the other grabbers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Internal"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
": These are grabbers which can be internally initiated from within Tvheadend "
"using a very simple scheduler. These are typically Internet-based services. "
"This can be a quick way to get richer EPG data where you don’t have decent "
"OTA support."
msgstr ""

msgid "External"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
": These provide the option to run grabber scripts externally and to send "
"data into Tvheadend via Unix domain sockets. It provides the ability to run "
"more complex configurations using things like cronjob’s, script chains, etc."

msgid "OpenTV"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
": This is a proprietary OTA EPG grabber. It’s known to be used on the SKY "

msgid "xmltv.org"

msgid ""
"for more information). To make use of the internal XMLTV grabber you "
"typically require the xmltv-utils package to be installed. If you install "
"new grabbers you will need to restart Tvheadend to pick these up as they’re "
"loaded at startup. If you see no XMLTV grabbers listed then most probably "
