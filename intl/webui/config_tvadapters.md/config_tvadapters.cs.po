msgid "Tune Repeats"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
": Number of repeats for the tune requests (default is zero - no repeats)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note: this represents the number of repeats, not the number of requests - so "

msgid "Status Period"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
": By default, linuxdvb's status read period is 1000ms (one second). The "
"accepted range is 250ms to 8000ms. Note that for some hardware or drivers "
"(like USB), the status operations take too much time and CPU. In this case, "
"increase the default value. For fast hardware, this value might be decreased "
"to make the decision of the re-tune algorithm based on the signal status "
"faster."
msgstr ""

msgid "Force old status"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
": Always use the old ioctls to read the linuxdvb status (signal strength, "
"SNR, error counters). Some drivers are not mature enough to provide the "
"correct values using the new v5 linuxdvb API."

msgid "Full DiseqC"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
": Always send the whole DiseqC sequence including LNB setup (voltage, tone). "
"If this is not checked, only changed settings are sent, which may cause "
"issues with some drivers. If the tuning is not reliable, try activating this "
"option."
msgstr ""

msgid "Turn off LNB when idle"
msgstr ""

msgid ": Turn off LNB when it is not used. It may save some power."

msgid "Master Tuner"
msgstr ""

msgid ": Select the master tuner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The signal from the standard universal LNB can be split using a simple "
"coaxial splitter (no multiswitch) to several outputs. In this case, the "
"position, the polarization and low-high band settings must be equal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you set other tuner as master, then this tuner will act like a slave one "

msgid "Next tune delay in ms (0-2000)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"!Box Cable 6490, report wrong number of tuners and this setting allows you "

msgid "Force teardown delay"
