msgid "Configuration - Stream - Elementary Stream Filters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This table defines rules to filter and order the elementary streams (PIDs) "
"like video or audio from the input feed. The execution order of commands is "
"granted. It means that first rule is executed for all available streams then "
"second and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid "NOTE:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If any elementary stream is not marked as ignored or exclusive, it is used. "
"If you like to ignore unknown elementary streams, add a rule to the end of "
"grid with the any (not defined) comparisons and with the action ignore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The rules for different elementary stream groups (video, audio, teletext, "
"subtitle, CA, other) are executed separately (as visually edited)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the visual verification of the filtering, there is a service info dialog "
"in the Configuration / DVB Inputs / Services window . This dialog shows the "
"received PIDs and filtered PIDs in one window."
