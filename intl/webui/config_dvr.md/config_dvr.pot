msgid "Media container"
msgstr ""

msgid ": Select the container format used to store recordings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cache scheme"
msgstr ""

msgid ": Select the cache scheme used to store recordings. Leave as “system” unless you have a special case for one of the others."
msgstr ""

msgid "Whenever you read or write data to the filesystems, the information is kept (cached) in memory for a while. This means that regularly-access files are available quickly without going back to the disc; it also means that there’s a disconnect when writing between the write request (from the application) and the actual write itself (to the disc/storage) as changes are buffered to be written in one go."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unknown"
msgstr ""

msgid ": A placeholder status, meaning that the configuration isn’t properly set."
msgstr ""

msgid "System"
msgstr ""

msgid ": Change nothing and rely on standard (default) system caching to behave as it normally would."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not keep"
msgstr ""

msgid ": Tell the system that you’re not expecting to re-use the data soon, so don’t keep it in cache. The data will still be buffered for writing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Useful e.g. in a RAM-limited system like a Pi (given that you’re unlikely to be watching while recording, so data can be discarded now and read back from disc later)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sync"
msgstr ""

msgid ": Tell the system to write the data immediately. This doesn’t affect whether or not it’s cached."
msgstr ""

msgid "Useful e.g. if you’ve a particular problem with data loss due to delayed write (such as if you get frequent transient power problems)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sync + Do not keep"
msgstr ""

msgid ": A combination of last two variants above - data is written immediately and then discarded from cache."
msgstr ""

msgid "DVR Log retention time (days)"
msgstr ""

msgid ": Time that Tvheadend will keep information about the recording in its internal database. Notice that the actual recorded file will not be deleted when the log entry is deleted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Extra time before recordings (minutes)"
msgstr ""

msgid ": Specify the number of minutes to record before the events scheduled start time. Used to cope with small scheduling errors."

msgid "Extra time after recordings (minutes)"

msgid ": If checked, broadcasts with matching title and matching non-zero episode number are considered duplicates."
msgstr ""

msgid "EPG update window"
msgstr ""

msgid ": Maximum difference between event start times when the EPG event is changed. TVHeadend uses a fuzzy match logic (using title, start times, duration, episode) to check when the event was changed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Post-processor command"
msgstr ""

msgid ": Command to run after finishing a recording. The command will be run in background and is executed even if a recording is aborted or an error occurred. Use the %e error formatting string to check for errors, the error string is “OK” if recording finished successfully."
