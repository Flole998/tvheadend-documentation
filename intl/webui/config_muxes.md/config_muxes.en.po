"Muxes are locations at which services can be found. On traditional networks "
"(DVB-C, -T and -S), these are carrier signals on which the individual "
"channels are multiplexed, hence the name. However, Tvheadend also uses the "
"term ‘mux’ to describe a source for multiple IP streams - so an IP address, "
"in effect."
