msgstr ""

msgid ": with a subsequent explanation"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is definition list formatting"
msgstr ""

msgid "They may render the same here, but note the extra leading spaces in the second example: this means that they will convert differently for use in the web interface help. That in turn means your formatting will be all over the place unless you handle the dl/dt/dd formatting in Tvheadend's CSS."

msgid "Admonitions"
msgstr ""

msgid "Admonitions in markdown/mkdocs rely on a python extension, which works well in the base guide but doesn't survive the pandoc translation to standalone HTML for the webUI."

msgid "Other HTML"
msgstr ""

msgid "As a general rule, you can include any HTML in markdown if you need it. It does defeat the easy-to-write/easy-to-read object, though, so use only as necessary."
