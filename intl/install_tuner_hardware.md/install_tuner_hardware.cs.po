"This section will give you some basic ideas on how to get your tuner working "
"with your operating system. However, it's clearly way beyond the scope of "
"this guide to tell you everything: consult specialist forums, search around, "
"and at least do some research to work out what's likely to work or not "
"before you hand over any money."
