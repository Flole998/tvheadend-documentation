"This section will give you some basic ideas on how to get your tuner working "
"with your operating system. However, it's clearly way beyond the scope of "
"this guide to tell you everything: consult specialist forums, search around, "
"and at least do some research to work out what's likely to work or not "
"before you hand over any money."

"Similar to the above, Tvheadend can do nothing if your tuners aren't working "

"Many tuners require firmware - normally, a binary file that's been extracted "
"from the proprietary drivers used by Windows. Many Linux distros include a "
"package for the most common devices (e.g. linux-firmwares under Ubuntu or "
"firmware-linux-nonfree under Debian). If this isn't sufficient, a good "
"source of firmware files is the OpenElec git repository:"
