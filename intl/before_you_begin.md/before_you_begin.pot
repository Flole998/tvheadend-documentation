msgid "There are some basic concepts that will make life much easier if you understand them from the outset."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hardware/Software Fundamentals"
msgstr ""

msgid "A"
msgstr ""

msgid "tuner"
msgstr ""

msgid "is the hardware (chipset) needed to interpret a digital television signal and extract from it the programme stream. The tuner hardware is also responsible for communicating with your satellite dish via the LNB in the case of DVB-S."
msgstr ""

msgid "driver"
msgstr ""

msgid "is the piece of software that your operating system uses to talk to the tuner. This can be built into the OS (e.g. 'supported since kernel X') or might be a separate piece of software that you need install, and maybe even compile, separately."
msgstr ""

msgid "Firmware"
msgstr ""

msgid "is a small piece of binary microcode that your system driver sends to the tuner upon initialisation. This is the cause of more problems than you'd imagine... if you find yourself in trouble, this is the first thing to check along with kernel support for your hardware."
msgstr ""

msgid "Application/Tvheadend Fundamentals"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Tvheadend software then sets up a series of configuration elements, and the way in which these interact determines how a TV signal ends up in front of you. They all use what's known as a"
msgstr ""

msgid "many-to-many"
msgstr ""

msgid "relationship, in that one configuration element can be related to multiple elements of the next type, and vice versa: one tuner has multiple networks, one network can exist on multiple tuners."
msgstr ""

msgid "The"
msgstr ""

msgid "network"
msgstr ""

msgid "is the software definition of your carrier network. Broadly, it lays out what sort of network it is (such as DVB-T or DVB-S2), how it gets scanned, where the DVB-S satellite is in orbit, and similar. Networks are used by tuners so the hardware knows where to look for a signal."
msgstr ""

msgid "Networks then have"
msgstr ""

msgid "muxes"
msgstr ""

msgid ". These are the carrier frequencies that exist on the old analogue channels that are used to transmit multiple digital signals rather than a single analogue one. These signals are multiplexed together, hence the name"
msgstr ""

msgid "mux"
msgstr ""

msgid "."
msgstr ""

msgid "Muxes then carry"
msgstr ""

msgid "services"
msgstr ""

msgid ". These are the individual streams of data. They can be TV or radio programmes, they can provide data services such as digital teletext, or they can be used as part of the control code for catch-up IPTV services."
msgstr ""

msgid "And finally, services are mapped to"
msgstr ""

msgid "channels"
msgstr ""

msgid ". These are what you and your client software think in terms of:"
