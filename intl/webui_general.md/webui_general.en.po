msgid "General Overview of Web Interface"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tvheadend is operated primarily through a tabbed web interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are some basic navigation concepts that will help you get around and "
"make the best of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Page Structure"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The interface is made up of nested tabs, so similar functions are grouped "
"together (e.g. all configuration items at the top level, then all "
"configuration items for a particular topic are below that)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each tab is then typically laid out with a menu bar across the top that "
"provides access to Add/Save/Edit-type functions, and a grid like a "
"spreadsheet below that. The grid items are frequently editable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most configuration items - certainly the ones that are common to all types "
"of item covered by that tab - are in this grid. However, some item-specific "
"configuraiton items are then only available through the"
msgstr ""

msgid "Add"
msgstr ""

msgid "and"
msgstr ""

msgid "Edit"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"dialog boxes. For example, the main network configuration tab grid covers "
"parameters common to DVB-S, -T, -C and IPTV networks, but specific things "
"such as FEC rolloff or mux URL are then only in the dialogs for networks "
"that need these values."
msgstr ""

msgid "Displaying and Manipulating Columns"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Not all columns are necessarily visible. If you hover your mouse over a "
"column heading, you'll see a down arrow - click here, and a drop-down menu "
"will appear to give you access to"
msgstr ""

msgid "which columns are shown and which are not"
msgstr ""

msgid "."
msgstr ""

msgid "The same drop-down menu gives you access to a"
msgstr ""

msgid "sort"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"function if defined (it doesn't always make sense to have a sortable column "
"for some parameters). You can also sort a column by simply clicking on the "
"column header; reverse the sort order by clicking again."
msgstr ""

msgid "And the same drop-down menu also gives you access to a"
msgstr ""

msgid "filter"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"function if defined. The filter does simple pattern-matching on any string "
"you provide."
msgstr ""

msgid "Re-arrange"
msgstr ""

msgid "the columns by simply dragging he header to a new spot."
msgstr ""

msgid "Re-size"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"the columns by dragging the very edges of the column header as required."
msgstr ""

msgid "Editing Fields"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To edit a cell, double click on it. After a cell is changed, a small red "
"flag or triangle will appear in the top-left corner to indicate that it has "
"been changed. These changes can now be kept ("
msgstr ""

msgid "Save"
msgstr ""

msgid "button), or abandoned ("
msgstr ""

msgid "Undo"
msgstr ""

msgid "button)."
msgstr ""

msgid "To change a checkbox or radio button, click once."
msgstr ""

msgid "To add a new entry, press the"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"button. The new (empty) entry will be created on the server but will not be "
"saved and will not necessarily be enabled. You can now change all the cells "
"to the desired values, check the ‘enable’ box if applicable and then press"
msgstr ""

msgid "to activate the new entry."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most rows are multi-selectable, so you can carry out certain actions on more "
"than one entry at the same time. So, for example, you can select multiple "
"items by using"
