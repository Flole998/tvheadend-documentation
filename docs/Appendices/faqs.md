## FAQ: Frequently-asked Questions

### Q: How do I get a playlist for all my channels?

Tvheadend can generate a playlist of all your mapped services (channels). You can download it from the webui at http://IP:Port/playlist. E.g. http://192.168.0.2:9981/playlist.

### Q: Why am I getting a playlist when trying to view/stream a channel?

By default Tvheadends play links are playlists, you can bypass this by removing the /play/ path from the url. Some players, Media Player Classic Home Cinema for example refuse to play the playlists generated by Tvheadend.

### Q: Tvheadend has scanned for services but some rows in the Service Name column are blank, is that normal?

Yes, not all services are given a name by providers. These services are usually hidden for a reason & are often used for things such as encrypted guide data for settop boxes or interactive services and so on.

If you're not seeing any service names at all this may indicate an issue with your hardware and/or configuration.

### Q: I get a blank page when trying to view the web interface!

This usually happens when Tvheadend is installed incorrectly, make sure that the path /usr/share/tvheadend/src/webui/static/ exists and isn't empty. 

Note: The above path only applies to Debian/Ubuntu systems others may differ.
