##Configuration - Access Entries

Setting up access control is an important initial step as **<u>the system
is initially wide open</u>**. 

Tvheadend verifies access by scanning through all enabled access control
entries in sequence, from the top of the list to the bottom. The permission
flags, streaming profiles, DVR config profiles, channel tags and so on are
combined for all matching access entries. An access entry is said to match
if the username / password matches and the IP source address of the
requesting peer is within the prefix.

contain a single asterisk (`*`).

should be the same (i.e. match any username/password combination, or no
username/password required).

**Network prefix**
: IPv4 prefix for matching based on source IP address. If set to `0.0.0.0/0`
it will match everything. The multiple networks can be delimited using

Letâ€™s also take a look at an example:

![Access Entries Example](docresources/accessconfigexample.png)

The first line gives clients originating from *192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255*
network access to streaming functions. Typically, you would use this for
your local media players at home (Although Movian can prompt for username
and password in its HTSP client)

The second line adds a user with world wide access who might want to
modify recordings, etc., perhaps from their workplace or via a mobile 'phone.

The third line provide admin access to an *admin* user. As an extra
precaution this user is only allowed to log in from the home network.
