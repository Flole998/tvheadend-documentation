##Configuration - Channel/EPG - Channel Tags

This tab is used to configure channel tags. Tags are used to define a
set of channels - to group them, to aid searches, and similar. Tags are not
required by Tvheadend itself, but are useful in media applications such
as Kodi and are a requirement for using Tvheadend with Movian.

####Grid Items

The main grid items have the following functions:

**Enabled**
: Make the tag available in the rest of the system. If the tag is not
  enabled it is only presented in this grid for the administrator.

**Name**
: Name of the tag. Changing the tag name does not interfere with any
  automatic recordings, groups, etc.

**Internal**
: Tags are exported via HTSP/HTTP and used there for grouping of TV
  channels. If you do not wish to export a tag you can flag it as internal
  only.

**Private**
: Tags are exported via HTSP/HTTP and used there for grouping of TV
  channels. If you do not wish to export a tag to other users you can flag
  it as private only. Only users with this tag configured in the access
  configuration (or users with not set tags) can use it.

**Icon**
: Full path to an icon used to depict the tag. This can be a TV network
  logotype, etc.

**Icon has title**
: If set, presentation of the tag icon will not superimpose the tag name
  on top of the icon.

**Comment**
: Allows the administrator to set a comment only visible in this editor.
  It does not serve any active purpose.
