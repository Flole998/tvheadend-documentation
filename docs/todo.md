##Things To Do on This Guide... 

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Work-in-progress notes</p>
<p>These are not part of the final product, obviously!<br><br>They're just some
of the areas I'm aware of that we need to close off before release</p>

1. Replace all current screenshots with up-to-date, consistent, readable images (suitable for webUI and User Guide)

2. Minor file renaming to improve consistency (e.g. config_misc shoudl be config_general)

4. Once 99% complete, generate new webUI help pages and push them to the tvheadend repo

5. Check all link from tvh (e.g. there are no help buttons on the 'Stream' tabs)

6. Might be worth taking a few specific screenshots of dialog boxes

7. Check non-univeral (i.e. item-specific) configuration items (e.g. the IPTV mux parameters) and make sure they're documented

8. Obviously, fill in the minor gaps as highlighted in the document: buttons, descriptions, etc.

9. Regenerate everything as soon as mkdocs 0.14 hits the streets - copyright on template footers, collapsible menus (perhaps), search bug fixed

The following major content items/chapters are then missing - based on most FAQs on the forum:

* Transcoding

* How to configure a recording

* How to watch Live TV

* How to set up card sharing?

* How to set up a multi-profile installation (access)

* How to compile/install on <insert your distro here>

* Setting up SAT>IP - as a client, as a server

* Platform differences - what you need to transcode, or what you can expect from Android vs GNU/Linux

And I'm left with these final open questions:

* We need the webUI pages documented (as they are). How much should they be the how-tos, and how much should these be separate?

* How deep do we want to (need to) get into setting up tuners - that's a constant source of woe for people?

* If we do all the above, do we need the FAQ pages? Check existing manual/guide
